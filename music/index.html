        <p>During elementry, middle, and highschool, I participated in my school band.</p>
        <p>Once I came to college (RIT), I joined the Game Symphony Orchestra (GSO). As the name implies, it is a group of people who only play music sourced from videogames.
            It has been amazing playing with this group of talented musicians, and I have even started transcibing compisitions to play with the group. 
            You can find them on <a href="https://musescore.com/user/55647404">my MuseScore</a>. 
            Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RITGameSymphonyOrchestra">RIT GSO</a> youtube channel.
